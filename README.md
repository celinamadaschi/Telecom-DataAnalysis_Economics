# Telecom-DataAnalysis_Economics

This is the repository we used to store our code and data.

- In the 'JEL_Code_Data', you may find the code we used to extract the different JEL codes of each article we found on REPEC, with the csv_s countaining each letters

- 'gender_analysis' contains the code used for the gender anlysis but without the R regression model which is in a separate file
  
- regression.R is our R code used for the gender analysis
  
- 'scraping-auteur-affiliation' was used to scrape the institution each author and its affiliation
  
- 'processing_and_cluster_study_p30' is the Jupyter Notebook we used to produce the brief analysis in our appendix p30

- 'matching author' was used to match the two databases with the affiliation on one side and with the JEL code on the other side
