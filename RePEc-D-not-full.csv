All these occurred on the background of rapid digitalisation, computerisation, and automation processes of the economic sectors, the highest risks being born by the labour market and the main production factor: the human factor.

The concept and features of the land for organic farming, especially the legal regime of such land are revealed. The analysis of legal forms of land use for organic farming was carried out. The main advantages of using an organic land plot on the basis of emphyteusis are analyzed. The subjects of land use for organic farming have been investigated. The prospective directions are determined and proposals on the improvement of the current legislation of Ukraine are developed. These include the development and approval of criteria for determining the suitability of agricultural land for use in the process of organic farming, resolving at the legislative level issues related to soil conservation and the protection of their fertility, the development and approval of norms of their qualitative condition that would meet the requirements of cultivation organic products of plant origin.

D,The paper studies endogenous employment and distribution dynamics in a Post-Keynesian growth model of the KaleckiÃ¢â¬âSteindl tradition. Abstract: Productivity adjustments stabilise employment and the labour share in the long run: technological change allows firms to replenish the reserve army of workers in a struggle over income shares and thereby keeps wage demands in check. Labour market dynamics follow from separate wage and price curves. The authors discuss stability conditions and the equilibrium dynamics and investigate how legal working time and its reduction affect this equilibrium,Ederer Stefan; Rezai Armon,Review of Keynesian Economics,2022.0,Journal Article,,https://econpapers.repec.org/article/elgrokejn/v_3a10_3ay_3a2022_3ai_3a3_3ap355-381.htm
